Tasks for learning Java

1. Hello World

Write a program that prints out "Hello Word", and make it run.
Hint: System.out.println is a method that prints out a line.

2. Counting

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10, each on a separate line.
Hint: Use a "for" loop.
Hint: In Java, an easy way to turn any variable into a string to print is to append it to the end
	of an empty string, like this:
	
	int number = 42;
	String numberString = "" + number;
	

3. More complex counting

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, with ten numbers on each line, like this:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
...
Hint: System.out.print is a method that prints a string without moving to a new line

4. My first method

Write a "power" method. This function computes x to the y power. Here's what it should look like:

static int power(int x, int y) {
	// your code goes here
}

Call this method from "main" with several different combinations of x and y, and print out the result, like:
2 to the power of 3 is 8
3 to the power of 4 is 81
10 to the power of 5 is 100000
...

Hint: In Java, an easy way to build strings is by using + to append them, like this:
	String name = "Pikachu";
	int age = 3;
	String message = name + " is " + age + " years old.";
	 
5. Power table

Write a "powerTable" method to print out a table of x to the power of y. In this table, "x" counts the numbers
as you go from left to right in the table, and "y" counts the numbers as you go from top to bottom
in the table. Each number in the table is calculated using the "power" method that you wrote for problem 4.

The result should look like this:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024
3 9 27 81 273 729 2187 6561 19683 59049
4 16 64 256 1024 4096 16384 65536 262144 1048576
5 25 125 625 3125 15625 78125 390625 1953125 9765625
